# Just some data analytics/visualisation on football! 
mostly Arsenal related...

Below is an example of some visualisations I have created!

This figure plots a radar chart comparing an Arsenal player (Bukayo Saka) from the 22/23 season to the 23/24 season.

And this figure compares Aaron Ramsdale (22/23) to David Raya (23/24).

I did this for each player in the Arsenal XI, and added each figure to a dashboard.
The figure plots a radar chart in each position in the Arsenal XI, where the radar chart compares the 22/23 and 23/24 players.

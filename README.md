# Just some data analytics/visualisation on football! 
mostly Arsenal related...

Below is an example of some visualisations I have created!

This figure plots a radar chart comparing an Arsenal player (Bukayo Saka) from the 22/23 season to the 23/24 season.

</p>

And this figure compares Aaron Ramsdale (22/23) to David Raya (23/24).

</p>

I did this for each player in the Arsenal XI, and added each figure to a dashboard.
The figure plots a radar chart in each position in the Arsenal XI, where the radar chart compares the 22/23 and 23/24 players.

Another visualisation where I applied linear regression analysis to predict the position/rank of a team based on the number of points they achieved in a season.

The following plot compares the points/position relationship across two different PL <i> era's </i>. After Arsenal had agonisingly lost out to City again in their battle for the 23/24 Premier League, I believed that pre-City's dominance Arsenal would have been triumphant. As a coping mechanism, I was interested to see whether a team would need more points to win the league in the current era compared to previous years.
